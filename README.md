# README

This is a public event posting and RSVP application. Think of it like meetup, but with a less haphazard interface. 

Clone or download the app onto your own machine. Use the terminal on your machine to 'cd' into the home directory, and then enter the following commands:

* bundle

* rails db:migrate

* rails db:seed

* rails s

Then visit localhost:3000 in your web browser to view the project.
